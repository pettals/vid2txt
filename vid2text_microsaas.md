**Tagline:** *"Turn any video into instant, shareable insights."*

## Problem
- Professionals, researchers, marketers, and students often **don’t have time to watch long videos**.  
- Many webinars, podcasts, lectures, and talks contain **key information that’s hard to skim**.

   - Short **TL;DR** bullet points  
   - **Detailed summary** for blog/newsletter  
   - **Key quotes** & timestamps  
   - **Action items / main takeaways**  
4. **Share or export** directly to social media, Google Docs, Notion, or email.
